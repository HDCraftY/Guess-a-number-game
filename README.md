# Guess-a-number-game
In this Phython program you can choose a number and another person has unlimited tries to guess that chosen number. Usually you should tell the person, that it is a number between e.g. 1 and 10. When the person guesses correctly he will get a congratulation notification and a message of how many tries he did.
